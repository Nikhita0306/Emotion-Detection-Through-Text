# Emotion-Detection-Through-Text

Developed a machine learning model to detect and classify emotions from text data, encompassing data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation stages. Responsibilities included cleaning and preprocessing the text data by removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and handling missing values. Utilized TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction to transform text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms. Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier using the scikit-learn library for emotion classification and evaluated the model's performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilized tools and technologies such as Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK, applying machine learning techniques including the Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF Vectorization.
